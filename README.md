# HACKXX_DefNote


## Inspiration

Looking up terms in an acedemic article could be tedious. With no fast explaination of terms, students waste time searching for termiologies, and more than often get tired before finishing the whole paper.  We want to help users to have more time for learning and achieving their careers. 

>>We believe that women, with their great capability in any acedemic, have great future in (how to incooprparete women!ahah

## What it does
We created a web application that allows users to input passages from class, and auto identifies and defines the terms that most needed to be explained using Natural Language Processing API and python wiki package. After processing with our built database, the user could view the text at ease: for terms needed explanation, they would hover their mouse over the word, and the definition would be displayed in the definition box. After reading the text, users could also create a set of notecards by one click. 

## How we built it
We built the backend through:: Dillon! here ;P
After completing the algorithm, we created a website to host the application using HTML5, CSS, and JavaScript. The website includes the structure of the application on the left, and perform the text intake, reading with definition, and notecard functions on the right hand side. Through this web app, users learn termiologies from text that are hard to understand with ease. 

## Challenges we ran into
Making our first webapp is very challenging.
